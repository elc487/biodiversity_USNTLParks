# biodiversity_USNTLParks
This project is looking at the Biodiversity of US National Parks in a set of data obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity
I chose to do a project on this as I enjoy nature and am an avid bird watcher. I thought it would be fun to look at all the species in National Parks.
This quickly changed once I began to parse through the data as I saw some interesting information and began to delve deeper into that subset of the data.
I was able to use geopandas and matplotlib in my notebook to plot my data out in hopefully a visually informing way.
